# COMPSCI400

<p> Projects that I did in COMP SCI 400: Programming III. 
  <br>
  <b> Project 01: HashTable </b> is a data structure that implements an associative array or dictionary. It is an abstract data type that maps keys to values
  <br>
  <b> Project 02: Red Black Tree </b> is a kind of self-balancing binary search tree. Each node stores an extra bit representing "color" ("red" or "black"), used to ensure that the tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions.
  <br> 
  <b> Project 03: Dijkstra's Algorithm <b> is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.
  <br>
  <b> JavaFx: </b> a set of graphics and media packages that enables developers to design, create, test, debug, and deploy rich client applications that operate consistently across diverse platforms.
